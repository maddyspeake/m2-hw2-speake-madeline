        <p><p style="color:navy"><b>Hello to all my new MMC5277 friends! My name is Maddy, welcome to my Recipe Realm. I'm really enthusiastic about cooking, and love to share recipes I learn with my friends. So what better way to introduce you all to me, than to do so on my first webpage! I got into cooking out of necessity, because eating out is expensive &#128517; What started out as a chore became really exciting to me as I discovered different online recipe sources, which helped me sort of teach myself with practice. I hope you enjoy exploring these as much as I did (and do)!</b></p>
