        <p><p style="color:navy;font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;text-align: center"><b>Hello to all my new MMC5277 friends! My name is Maddy, welcome to my Recipe Realm. 
        I'm really enthusiastic about cooking, and love to share recipes I learn with my friends. So what better way to 
        introduce you all to me, than share them with you on my first webpage! I got into cooking out of necessity, because eating 
        out is expensive &#128517; What started out as a chore became really exciting to me as I discovered different cool online 
        recipe sources, which helped me teach myself with practice. I hope you enjoy exploring these as much as I did (and do)!</b></p>

        <h2 style="color:dodgerblue; font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; text-align: center;"> &#127859; MY FAVORITE COOKS &#127859; </h2>
       <p style="color:navy;font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;text-align: center;">I've found a couple of people whose recipes just wow me every time. They each have cookbooks and disperse some of 
        their recipes on their sites. Also, hot tip: if you want a certain cookbook but don't want to splash out $40, a lot of
    them are available at public libraries!</p>

    This recipe is so flavorful, it reminds me a lot of the food my aunt from Thailand makes. If you've watched Salt Fat Acid 
    Heat, you'll love the way this recipe hits each of the major taste profiles. It also gives me an excuse to go to the Asian market, which is always fun!</details></li>
<li><details><summary><a href=https://www.seriouseats.com/french-onion-soup-recipe">French Onion Soup by Serious Eats</a></summary>
There are a million things I can say to sell you on this recipe. I am a soup addict, I will eat soup every day, even on the most sizzling scorching days of Florida summer. Also, onions were 
the first vegetable I ever liked - shoutout to the hibachi onion volcano. This recipe taught me the virtue of patience in how 
long it <i>really</i> takes to caramelize onions properly, but it is so worth it. This site - Serious Eats - is such a treasure
trove of knowledge on really well-tested recipes and the theories/methods behind making them, so trust me and try this soup. </details></li>
<li><details><summary><a href="https://www.alisoneroman.com/recipes/skillet-chicken-with-white-beans-and-caramelized-lemon">Skillet Chicken Thighs with White Beans and Caramelized Lemon</a></summary>
This recipe really got me into bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs. Yes, the bone is more to work around, but its presence imparts
so much flavor in the meat, and the way the fat in the skin sears off creates an insane sauce of its own. The addition of 
the juicy caramelized lemons and aromatic shallots makes it smell and taste luxurious. Also you feel healthy because you're 
eating kale, and it's actually really good. Boom, all-around great meal.</details></li>
<li><details><summary><a href="https://www.andybaraghani.com/recipes/green-goddess-chicken-thighs">Green Goddess Chicken Thighs</a></summary>
    I am a firm believer in having everything as saucy as possible, and this recipe both marinates in the beautiful Green 
    Goddess sauce, AND is finished with it. When I make this recipe, I buy about double the radishes, because I love them and their 
    wonderful peppery crunchiness. Also if you can't grill it as called for in the recipe, it's still good cooked over the stove 
    (but the grill char just really adds a lot if you can!). </details></li>
    <li><details><summary><a href="https://www.alisoneroman.com/recipes/spicy-chicken-salad">Spicy Fennel Chicken Salad</a></summary>
I actually ate this just before writing this code! I love all things crunchy, spicy, and garlicky, and this is both refreshing 
and satisfying. As a salad, it keeps really well over the days on the strong backbones of the celery, fennel, and romaine. 
The oil dressing you make at the beginning is an awesome way to learn about blooming spices, which really amplifies their 
natural flavor!</details></li>

<h2 style="color:dodgerblue; font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; text-align: center;">&#128054;MY SOUS CHEF&#128054;</h2>
<center><img src="Images\howie2.jpg"></center>
<p style="font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;text-align: center;color: navy;">The most important ingredient of all is the loved one(s) you share your food with, who ideally will help you through your 
    cooking journey. Thankfully, I have an industry expert by my side. I will know if something is good if my buddy Howie 
    runs into the kitchen to try to knock me out of the way of the food. His palate is so refined that my father in law claims
    that he can tell the difference between different cheddars (I think he just wants to eat any cheese he can find). So be sure
    to find yourself a quality sous chef of your own, or at the very least, a special somebody to share your tasty treats with. &#128516;
